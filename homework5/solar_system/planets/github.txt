1. $ pwd

2. $ ls for key repositories, $ ls -a for everything. All files and repositories inside the repository “music” will be listed.

3. $ nano patterns.txt

4. $ cat patterns.txt

5. $ diff patterns.txt symmetry.txt

6. $ mv ~/music/patterns.txt
 ~/math/calculus/patterns.txt

7. $ rm triangle.txt

8. $ cd ../math

9. $ git init

10. $ git remote add origin [ssh url]

11. $ cp symmetry.txt ../math

12. $ git status
 “symmetry.txt” is not currently being tracked, because it was just added to the local repository and we did not run “$ git add” after its addition.

13. $ git add symmetry.txt
$ git add .

14. “symmetry.txt” is now being tracked
$ restore --staged symmetry.txt

15. $ git commit -m “Committed”

16. $ git push origin main
 “origin” is a nickname for the repo we see when we run “$ git remote -v” and this is the branch we want the file to go to

17. $ mkdir “applied math”

18. $ cd “applied math”

19. $ cd ../..
$ git add .
$ git commit -m “Committed”
$ git push origin main
I would switch back to the original branch before committing so I can commit everything at once instead of doing them one at a time.

20. $ git branch -a
The highlighted branch is the one I am on.

21. $ cd .. (but I’m already in “math” as of question 19)

22. $ rsync -avh “applied math”/* math/ (?)

23.
